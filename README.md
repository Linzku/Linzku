### Hi there 👋

👋 Hey there, I'm Linzku!

🎓 Currently navigating my way through the intriguing realms of second-year IT studies, I'm a passionate explorer of all things tech and art. My curiosity knows no bounds, but I find myself particularly drawn to UI/UX Design, Web Development, Cloud Computing, and DevOps 🤓📚. When I'm not immersed in code, you can catch me indulging in the art of problem-solving, diving into the immersive world of games 🎮, and weaving my creativity into art projects 🎨.

💡 Eager to learn, enthusiastic about UI/UX Design due to my previous studies as a designer, and fueled by a relentless curiosity, I'm on my way to unravel the mysteries of the digital universe. Join me on this journey as I try to document my adventures, navigating the ebbs and flows of my progress, and share my learnings. Let's turn the bits and bytes into something extraordinary! 💻✨
